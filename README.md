# Donkey Programming Language

# WIP

Donkey is a simple programming language designed for educational purposes. 

## Getting Started

To use Donkey, you'll need to install the Donkey compiler and runtime. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Clone the Donkey repository: `git clone https://github.com/JoachimR/donkey-lang.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build the compiler: `npm run build`
4. Run the program: `npm run start`

This will compile your Donkey program to JavaScript and run it using the Node.js runtime.
